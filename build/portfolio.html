        <h3 class="text-xl mt-5">Version 1</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">Every designer needs a portfolio. This site serves not only as a place to show off my designs, but also as a demo/laboratory for me to show off my Tailwind CSS skills. (I handmade this with love!) I didn't realize this till recently, but portfolios need designing too. What better place to start?</p>

            <figcaption>Version 1 was rough.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="text-lg">For the first iteration, I used a big hero image, a call to action button, and a small version of my logo. I even threw in a pun. I designed this without exploring the competition, and it shows. Version 1 looks nothing like a professional designer's portfolio. </p>

                <figcaption>My first design didn't look anything like these.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        <p class="text-lg">Creativity and individuality are so important. I don't want to <span class="italic">copy</span> other portfolios, but I definitely want to look professional. One of my mentors, Professor Chante Engh always tells me, "Designers are sponges." It's true.</p>
        <p class="text-lg">Aside from wanting to look professional, one of the variables of usability is familiarity. I want recruiters, hiring managers, and whoever else visits my page to find what they are looking for as smoothly and quickly as possible. These people typically have visited hundreds of portfolio pages in the past, so the more similar I can make mine to the best ones then the easier it will be for the target audience to navigate and use.</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl mt-5">Version 2</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">I got rid of the hero image since it felt dated and I wanted to make the portfolio more similar to other designers' portfolios. The pun had to go. I changed the menu button to give it a little flair.</p>
        <figure class="mx-auto w-fit">
            <img src="img/screenshots-for-portfolio/mobile-portfolio/version-2.png" alt="Version 2" class="border-solid border-2 border-custom-blue max-w-[374px] w-full">
            <figcaption>Version 2: evolution at work.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="text-lg">Positives from this revision were increased visibility for my project cards, a cleaner look, and more emphasis on the call to action button. Sitting back and looking at it, I asked myself: "What do people visiting this site want most? What are their priorities?" Visitors want to 1.) see my work and 2.) contact me. In that order. I realized there was no point in having a "Check out my work button" since visitors would have to scroll past that same button to see the project cards. So....</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl mt-5">Version 3</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">The project cards are now front and center. That's what visitors are here for anyways. I added a line under the "I'm a UX Designer" declaration that invites people to reach out to me. The intended visual heierarchy of the page is 1.) the logo 2.) the first project card 3a.) the menu button 3b.) the blue link to contact me.</p>
        <figure class="mx-auto w-fit">
            <img src="img/screenshots-for-portfolio/mobile-portfolio/version-3.png" alt="Version 3" class="border-solid border-2 border-custom-blue max-w-[374px] w-full">
            <figcaption>I finally felt like I was getting somewhere with Version 3.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="text-lg">The little logo with the blue border felt too insignificant, since my goal for the site is to establish my personal brand in addition to showing off my work. And when I made the logo big, the blue gradient felt too busy. So I opted for this all-black combination logomark. It tacks my name on, and the large size and bold form draw the eye immediately.</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl mt-5">Version 4</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">For Version 4 I tried to put the finishing touches on the design. I shortened the blue invite to connect to "Let's connect!" The shorter text increases readability and efficiency. It's less likely to be glossed over. I changed up the original hamburger menu button to a custom hamburger button I made that literally says 'menu'.</p>
        <figure class="mx-auto w-fit">
            <img src="img/screenshots-for-portfolio/mobile-portfolio/version-4.png" alt="Version 4" class="border-solid border-2 border-custom-blue max-w-[374px] w-full">
            <figcaption>That's more like it.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="text-lg">The pictures in the project cards had a lot of whitespace on the sides, looking a little awkward. Small things like that dan distract from the experience of a site visit. So I increased the width of the images and gave them a healthy abount of margin to still let them have some breathing room and whitespace.</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl mt-5">Version 5</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">When I actually build the design, I realized that the custom 'menu' hamburger button didn't fit the overall feel of the design, so I changed it back. And the project cards look a lot cleaner with the logos of the projects they represent. There's definitely room for improvement, and I am happy with how far the design has come! It now fulfills the goals of both me and the target audience. <a class="text-custom-blue" href="#">Let me know</a> if you have any suggestions.</p>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-lg flex flex-col gap-2">Lessons Learned
            <li>Iteration is so important to design. It's impossible to get it right on the first try.</li>
            <li>Make sure to check out the competition to get a feel for what works and what doesn't.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind the goals: the client's goals as well as the user's goals.</li>
            <li>Don't be afraid to make big changes in your design.</li>
        </ol>
